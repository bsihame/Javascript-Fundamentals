Instructions
For problems 1 and 2, write your answer in a comment (comments start with //) immediately below the line of code.

Example:

2 + 2
// number, 4
For problems 3-5, fill out the existing table or create a new one. See the table syntax guide

For problems 6-10, see the example in problem 6 and write your own answer below each question.

Problem One
What are the types of the following expressions and what do they evaluate to?

17

1 + 2 * 3 + 4

800 / 80 / 8

400 > 200

1 !== 1

true || false

true && false

20 % 6

"a" + "b"
Problem Two
What will the following return?

typeof 4

typeof "hello"

typeof true

2 === 1 || 3 === 4
Problem Three
Create a truth table for the expression A || B.

For reference, here is a truth table for the expression A && B. You can fill out the last column. Don't worry about keeping the spacing exact.

A	B	A && B	A ll B
true	true	true	
false	true	false	
true	false	false	
false	false	false	
Problem Four
Create a truth table for the expression !A && !B.

For reference, here is a truth table for the expression A && !B. You can fill out the last column. Don't worry about keeping the spacing exact.

A	B	!B	A && !B	!A && !B
true	true	false	false	
false	true	false	false	
true	false	true	true	
false	false	true	false	
Problem Five
Create a truth table for the expression !(A || B).

Problem Six
Write a step-by-step evaluation for the following expression (remember order of operations): 2 + 3 * 2 + 1. For reference, here is a exp of a step-by-step evaluation:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4
3 + 3 + 4
6 + 4
10
Problem Seven
Write a step-by-step evaluation for the following expression (remember order of operations): 4 / 2 + 8 / 4.

Problem Eight
Write a step-by-step evaluation for the following expression: 'ca' + 'ter' + 'pi' + 'llar'.

Problem Nine
Write a step-by-step evaluation for the following expression: 2 * 4 === 8 && 'car' + 'pool' === 'carpool'.

Problem Ten
Write a step-by-step evaluation for the following expression: '1' + '2' + '3' - '1'.
